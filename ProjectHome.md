I wrote this data service to pass data securely from my flex applications to PHP and back(it also works with AIR). I spent weeks trying to get AS3Crypto to work only to find out it doesn't work with PHP's mcrypt functions. This uses a set of JavaScript functions to encrypt the data client side. For security reasons I had to remove some security features before posting this so I recommend that you come up with your own. Also, it is every easy to decompile a SWF and somebody might be able to find your keys so I would recommend Obfuscating your program. This is generally a good idea anyway unless your program is open source. I would recommend SWF Encrypt from Amayeta software. On a final note I would love feed back on how to make the data service more secure or just plain better. I would also like to thank Chris Veness who's encryption functions this script is biased on.
